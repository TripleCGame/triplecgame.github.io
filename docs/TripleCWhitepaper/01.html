Wrong with Traditional Web2 Games?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-wrong-with-traditional-web2-games" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>From Super Mario to World of Warcraft to Honor of Kings, game developers have created classic games one after another on consoles, PCs, mobile phones and other terminals for decades, which have become an important part of human culture, captivating billions of loyal gamers. The quality of these games is at its peak, creating fascinating universes, making players mesmerized. The game industry also promotes the fast development of computer technology (software and hardware). It is said that if there were no games, there would be no such highly developed IT technology as it is now. </p><p>Games are not only a form of entertainment, but also an economic system. In the past few years, new forms have continuously emerged in the game industry, and finally evolved into the status quo of the Web2 industry that we see today. It has a huge player base, profitable models, and mature supporting infrastructures. Web2 gamers invest time and money to win games and achieve team or individual goals in games. In return, players gain knowledge and satisfaction.</p><p>Although the quality of traditional games is unparalleled, most traditional game developers regard the game data as their own. All profits and ownership of in-game items go only to development teams. Gold coins, gems or other names of &quot;money&quot; under this system are actually resources in the game. They are used to advance the game progress and promote the player&#x27;s strength. Whether players acquire them through time or money investment, players have no actual ownership over those digital assets. Should developers decide one account as violation, they could ban the player&#x27;s account and confiscate all digital assets. Developers have ultimate ownership and right for any usage of these digital assets.</p><p>In addition, games from different developers are isolated from each other, and the economic system is closed. No matter what channel you use to obtain the &quot;gold&quot; in traditional games, they cannot be exchanged back to fiat currency. Most of the assets in your game account cannot be legally or publicly traded, and private transactions between players are not protected. Of course, the gold of some traditional games allows players to trade between games, which may involve private fiat currency transactions, but the transaction value is very low, and is only restricted to one or two kinds of &quot;gold coins&quot;.</p><p>Moreover, the &quot;gold coins&quot; in traditional games constantly inflate over the life cycle of the game, and the inflation rate is very high. This means the utility value of each gold even within the same game is decreasing along time. To make sure about it, from time to time, a version update with a new consumption function is imposed by developers as a rough solution to deplete gold coins held by players. For example, a new weapon that is essential for leveling up is introduced that costs 100 times more gold coins than usual weapons. In Web2 games, those gold coins and old purchased weapons are only one click away from being worthless, if developers choose to do so. Players in traditional games are accustomed to such rules dictated by developers. </p><p>In short, the use and transaction of &quot;gold coins&quot; in traditional games are restricted within the scope specified by game developers. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-web3-gamefi-bring">What does Web3 GameFi Bring?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-does-web3-gamefi-bring" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>Blockchain based tokens and NFTs are introduced as tools to establish a new economic system (tokenomics) in games, so that GameFis, or so called Web3 games, are distinguished from traditional games. Such tokenomics is incorporated into the numerical/monetary setup of gameplay. </p><p>Web3 games grant players with digital sovereignty. The owning of tokens/NFTs or formally digital asset ownership is what differentiates Web3 games from traditional pay-to-play Web2 games. In GameFi, players&#x27; data, NFTs, and game tokens are completely owned by players. The digital assets, and their associated value and rights, belong to the Web3 gamers. For instance, gamers can transfer these NFTs out of the games and sell them for tokens and eventually real money. These transactions bridge the virtual world and the real world. Players can sell their assets to gain income, while others can buy game props to enhance their strength. This undeniable ownership defined on blockchain allows players to recover the value of their digital assets, either earned by time or money input. In some cases, they could even enjoy capital gains from their digital asset. </p><p>Moreover, in GameFi, player democracy will be achieved. With privileges embedded with their tokens, players have full rights to propose and vote in the game. Decisions from gameplay itself to grant allocation and governance could be voted on in the gaming community. The execution is accomplished according to definitions in the smart contract, without interference from the developers once the game is released. The greater number of tokens an individual holds, the greater voice and decision-making power one could enjoy. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-the-ideal-gamefi">What&#x27;s the Ideal GameFi?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-the-ideal-gamefi" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>The ideal GameFi should inherit the gameplay of traditional games, and at the same time combine with the open and decentralized economic system of web3, empowering games with finance. GameFi and traditional games should not be separated. All the fundamental elements of a good game design, such as storyline, strategy, interactions, payoff, aesthetics and mental challenges, should all be incorporated in the era of Web3. At present, however, the vast majority of GameFis are inferior to traditional games for every aspect on the entertainment side. </p><p>Secondly, it is through the combination of gameplay and finance, players have a variety of options. As a result, Web3 games is natural attractiveness for both play-for-fun and play-to-earn players. A healthy player structure should consist of both, but with play-for-fun taking up the majority of the player base. A gaming community thrives only by having true players dominating the game. Players immerse themselves in games for entertainment, while enjoying the added benefits of digital sovereignty and game democracy, not the other way around. That&#x27;s why content is vital. High quality content creates pleasant experiences. Through these experiences, true gamers develop attachment to the game, and are willing to invest in more tokens to explore higher levels in the game. And game democracy might also make them feel obliged to hold more tokens to vote for the direction of their games. In this case, although value preservation and even asset appreciation are possible, the motivation for players to obtain tokens is primarily for gaming and community activities, rather than speculation. These true gamers are the ones who build a concrete foundation for a sustainable game. </p><p>In addition, a well-designed tokenomics is crucial to put digital sovereinty and game democracy into practice. The traditional game has a monetary design that is well balanced between time/money input and rising levels. Should adding game tokens to the existing numerical system destroys such balance, the transformation of Web2 games to Web3 is not worth it. Even for newly developed Web3 games, a perfunctory tokenomics design will have a severely negative impact on GameFi&#x27;s ecology, and may easily collapse when no new opportunists enter. Such design is irresponsible to players, simply a catalyst for a death spiral. A good design of tokenomics is supposed to reach a perfect balance between supply and demand, and therefore positive feedback between crypto market value and game popularity.</p><p>Last but not least, all transactions and digital assets should be listed on blockchain to provide authentic decentralized Web3 experiences. Frequency of interactions generally defines the level of engagement of a game. The more popular the game is, the larger number of concurrent transactions are taking place, and therefore higher transaction fees on the blockchain (gas fees). A large scale Web3 game requires blockchain technology that allows large TPS (transactions per second) with low gas fees. Otherwise, the time and money loss outweighs the gain for on-chain benefits.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-restricts-the-growth-of-gamefi-market">What Restricts the Growth of GameFi Market?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-restricts-the-growth-of-gamefi-market" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>Despite all the benefits of Web3 games, there are currently four main pain points that limit the growth of the GameFi market:</p><p>I. High-quality GameFi products are in short supply. Most of the currently prevailing Web3 games are poor in playability and content, lacking all the attractiveness for players to immerse themselves for experiences. They are not built for entertainment but for opportunistic cash, basically graphic-wrapped Defi products. </p><p>II. Web3 game development from ground 0 is very challenging. The difficulty of high quality game development is now doubled in Web3 by adding blockchain and tokenomics on top of the already strenuous effort for recreational content, such as storyline, strategy and aesthetic design. </p><p>III. The player structure is unhealthy. Too many players in Web3 are playing to earn, so called DeFi users, rather than true gamers who play for fun. Games expanding over such unstable player base full of speculators can easily enter into Ponzi-scheme. The result is a quick-rise-quick-fall, a false prosperity followed by a plummeting death spiral.</p><p>IV. There are no widely available tools to facilitate Web2 to Web3 transitions. The gap between Web2 and Web3 is pretty big, for both developers and players. There are big shout-outs nowadays trying to educate the market, hoping to bring in more Web2 developers and players. However, this is not enough. If no convenient tools are available, the process entering Web3 is bumpy and sacrifices efficiency, then the gap cannot be closed. </p><p>V. Many of current Web3 games are not fully on chain. This is due to the low TPS (transactions per second) and high gas fees on blockchain, which basically decreases the efficiency of gameplay timewise and moneywise. To counter these issues, many developers choose to either decrease the number of in-game interactions (which sacrifices the gaming experiences), or only put partial digital assets on chain (leaving the rest in centralized server). Hence gameplay experiences and digital sovereignty give way to efficiency. </p><p>To solve the above, we need to leverage market-tested games and famous IP, streamline Web3 game production, merge Web2 &amp; 3 players to play-for-fun-and-earn, invent one-click transitional tools and increase on-chain efficiency. TripleC is in a unique position to offer all four on one plate.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/TripleCWhitepaper/summary"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Summary</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/docs/TripleCWhitepaper/02"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Who is TripleC?</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#whats-wrong-with-traditional-web2-games" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What&#39;s Wrong with Traditional Web2 Games?</a></li><li><a href="#what-does-web3-gamefi-bring" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What does Web3 GameFi Bring?</a></li><li><a href="#whats-the-ideal-gamefi" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What&#39;s the Ideal GameFi?</a></li><li><a href="#what-restricts-the-growth-of-gamefi-market" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What Restricts the Growth of GameFi Market?</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div>

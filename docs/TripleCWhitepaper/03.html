profitability and accessibility is a common trilemma faced by all GameFi. Many Web3 games give away playability due to technical challenges and time consumption to develop high-quality GameFis from ground 0. Even if the tech issues and time costs are manageable, extensive number of interactions at the same time on blockchain, which is necessary for an immersively entertaining game, may not be achievable because of TPS limit and appalling gas fees. This drawback further discounts the quality of Web3 games. Moreover, from the marketing side, a Web3 rooted developer usually lacks access to play-for-fun players. Thus, their profitability is only driven by play-to-earn users. This income normally sustains for a short period of time, and comes to an end when no new opportunists enter. </p><p>TripleC is going to inject Web3 with highly playable content and numerous play-for-fun players by leveraging its resources in Web2 game publishing. In addition, TripleC is going to develop its ecosystem on subnets with guaranteed efficiency for high TPS and minimum gas fee. With blockchain embedded cyber security and platform-enhanced traffic concentration, profitability, not for company but for players, will be naturally achieved when the golden three meet: security, efficiency and traffic. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transform-web2-games-to-web3">Transform Web2 Games to Web3<a class="hash-link" href="#transform-web2-games-to-web3" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As we mentioned earlier, traditional games and GameFi are not separated. GameFi should inherit the gameplay of traditional games and combine secured blockchain technology and efficient financial tools. Whether in Web2 or Web3, the time period for developing a new quality game is long, 3-5 years is not uncommon. Many Web2 game developers would like to focus their time on game playability itself, like storyline, strategy, graphic design etc. Or transform their currently avaibable Web2 games to Web3. But there is no widely available tools for easy adaption or conversion to Web3. This is where TripleC steps in. To shorten the development period without sacrificing quality, TripleC has already been contracted with top game studios to convert dozens of high-quality, market-tested traditional games into GameFis. Some of them are AAA level games with millions of existing players; Some of them derive from famous anime IPs that are backed by worldwide fans. These games with Web2 track records warrant content quality. They are built to attract traditional gamers, so as to form a concrete base of play-for-fun players on TripleC platform, bringing more active player groups to our game communities. With mature technology and infrastructure, TripleC brings about quality games instead of shabby products using the same, even shorter amount of time. The transformation is a full deployment of GaaS, which consists of the following parts:</p><p>I. Incubation:</p><p> i. SDK with API: to facilitate the development and to alleviate developers from learning and navigating the complex blockchain development ecosystem, TripleC will provide a set of SDKs with APIs for the developers to call for all blockchain operations, such as claiming, minting, burning, breeding, evolving, fusing, depositing, withdrawing and trading. For example, we have developed a technical tool for developers to mint and publish NFTs in the marketplace with literally just one click from scratch. </p><p> ii. Tokenomics consulting services: TripleC will advise the Web2 game developers to design token economies that are customized to their games. The tokenomic policy will be designed to define token utility and allocation schedule, to ensure a balance between token supply and demand. Specific rules are defined in section 4.1. </p><p>II. Publishing:</p><p> i. Marketing: TripleC will assist games to reach their targeted audience using our distribution channels and KOL network. On TripleC platform, we have SBT to direct data-driven marketing, as stated in section 3.5. Outside TripleC platform, we will fully leverage our resources in Web2 to tap suitable players through both online and offline promotions. </p><p> ii. Operation: games are further supported with long-term community activities primarily in our derivative content space. These derivative contents will guide players for tighter attachment and form a ground to naturally engage newcomers, as stated in section 3.6. DAO is derived from these communities and could utilize our platform tools to run, manage and promote their organization in a decentralized fashion. As usual practice in Web2, we will assist game developers with third party tools like discord and twitter, just to name a few, to maintain their game communities outside our platform as well. </p><p>In summary, We are a platform for one-stop GaaS services. we help developers who are not familiar with blockchain technologies enter the space of Web3 games. Developers with existing Web2 games could utilize our platform to add a stream of income. Developers could also design a brand-new game without worrying about tokenomics and smart contracts. By providing the TripleC Game SDK, along with the TripleC SaaS backend, tokenomics and other services, we streamline Web3 game development. Such streamlined production would bring in more resourceful developers, hence more quality games. And by publishing their games on our platform, developers also enjoy readily access to play-for-fun players.</p><p>In future, we will work with game studios to self-develop new Web3 games based on influential IPs. This would be a distilled extraction from our long-term resources and practices in technologies and marketing. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="merge-web23-players-to-play-for-fun-and-earn">Merge Web2&amp;3 Players to Play for Fun and Earn<a class="hash-link" href="#merge-web23-players-to-play-for-fun-and-earn" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In Web3 gaming, we see an opportunity to create experiences that appeal to both traditional gamers and DeFi users. These two groups are seperated by their motivations, play-for-fun vs. play-to-earn. Even when these two are the same people, the way they view Web2 and Web3 games are different. Successful Web2 games are natural gateway to guide traditional gamers to the world of Web3. As mentioned earlier, our primary strategy at this stage is to upgrade existing traditional games to blockchain games. Without discounting the playability of the game, this should not cause any discomfort for Web2 gamers, therefore lowering the threshold to enter Web3 to some extent. We are creating community-oriented GameFis that players could play for fun and earn. However, to merge these two worlds, it not only requires unconventional approach on the developer side, but also extensive education and adaption on the player side. Playing our games does not automatically make one a Web3 player. Convenient tools and behavioral guidance are still in need for frictionless transition. With some initial overlapping with Web2 boarding process, the steps to cultivate a devoted Web2&amp;3 player are as follows:</p><p>I. Engage: </p><p>New games are promoted for their playbility in player groups on and outside our platform. A cost-efficient way to match with players is through IP attraction and community interactions. For some of our games, attachment is inherently developed thanks to the fan base of world-famous IPs. SBTs on our platform (see section 3.5) boost targeted precise marketing. Web2 marketing coverage through usual game advertising channels, like youtube, facebook, etc., as well as KOL promotions, is still in place. All our games planned at this stage are free-to-play games. We have confidence in our game playability and IP attraction to draw attention of both Web2 and Web3 players. Once engaged, players can download our games from Google Play or App Store like any Web2 app. </p><p>II. Immerse: </p><p>We design the games with parallel courses for advancement. </p><p>For Web2 game players, they can enjoy games in the traditional way for interactive and enjoyable gaming experience. Like any typical free-to-play Web2 games, game tokens are earned by completing tasks in the game. Then these game tokens are spent to draw prizes, buy tools, weapons and avatars, basically consumed to push progress in the game. We will also keep the option for players to spend fiat currency to upgrade their tools or weapons if they choose so. All of the behavioral elements, Google store/App store downloading, free-to-play mode, challenges to earn game tokens, money spent to upgrade, etc., are collectively presented to provide authentic Web2 gaming experiences. However, unlike Web2 games, all the transactions are performed on blockchain in Web3 games. Those prizes/tools/weapons/avatars are in the form of NFTs, which means the game tokens consumed are used to mint NFTs, and all the upgrades are gears slotted to their NFTs. Whether players realize it or not, they actually earn and truly own their in-game digital assets while having fun.</p><p>For Web3 players who familiar with crypto wallet and crypto exchanges, besides all the activities mentioned above, they have another option to gain game tokens, that is to convert from CCCG tokens they purchase from crypto exchange. They could also use CCCG as the medium to exchange from one to another kind of game token on TripleC platform. These conversions can only take place in the TripleC wallet. Moreover, another privilege as a Web3 player is to buy and sell NFTs in TripleC market place using CCCG. Such tradings allows players to recover values of their digital assets, even achieve possible appreciation, all in protection of our platform. In this way, moving from one game to another is no longer a waste of money but an accumulation of wealth. </p><p>III. Merge: </p><p>Although our games are designed to adapt to both Web2 and Web3 players, the player benefit is only maximized by becoming a merged play-for-fun-and-earn Web2&amp;3 player. Unfortunately, there are still several barricades that hold back Web2 players mentally and practically. On the mental side, low-quality play-to-earn products and notorious death spirals scared many true gamers away. We will keep promoting our play-for-fun-and-earn proposition and guide Web2 players through rewards and education. </p><p>On the practical side, TripleC is working on several technologies that can ease the transition. For example, TripleC is developing an MPC (Multi-Party Computation) wallet with its partner to accomodate Web2 habits. One of the concepts that is difficult for Web2 players is private keys and seed phrases for wallet. Thinking of losing all digital asset to lost and stolen seed phrases, misplaced private keys is already scary. MPC is a hybrid solution for an overwhelming majority of new and current users, offering optimal tradeoffs between security, self-custody, recoverability, and interoperability. MPC wallet does not use seed phrases. It works by splitting the traditional private keys into multiple pieces, distributing them in multiple places to ensure no one person has full access to the traditional private key. This design allows no single point of failure and is entirely user controlled. What&#x27;s more important is the recovery process, it allows recovery using email, trusted contact, cloud backup, or biometric scan. This type of recovery is immediately more familiar for the majority of people, and is crucial for bringing new people into crypto systems.</p><p>IV. Devote: </p><p>When players cling to a game, they tend to acquire more game tokens either by devoting more time to earn or purchasing through CCCG. Once players are absorbed in various games on TripleC platform, them are expected to be involved in community activities. Voting, proposing, rewarding, just to name a few, are typical community activities in Web3 that encourage players&#x27; participation. Most community activities take place on the platform level, and use CCCG as a medium. In this case, although value preservation and even asset appreciation are possible, the motivation for players to obtain tokens is primarily for gaming and community activities, rather than speculation. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="build-a-powerful-game-platform-and-cohesive-metaverse">Build a Powerful Game Platform and Cohesive Metaverse<a class="hash-link" href="#build-a-powerful-game-platform-and-cohesive-metaverse" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="game-matrix">Game Matrix<a class="hash-link" href="#game-matrix" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>With our GaaS services and extensive pipeline of products, a steady stream of high-quality games will be continuously infused onto the platform, hence form a game matrix. Each game is a DApp that is published by TripleC on our platform but downloadable in Google Play/App Store. TripleC covers wide range of game types, including MOBA, SLG, FPS, MMORPG, SRPG, CAG, 4X, etc. Games selection is based on high quality standards, regardless of types. Wide exposures of game categories attract various types of players, shaping a diversified game community. For players, TripleC is a one-stop platform to discover new games, play for fun and earn. Players have the freedom to hop on various games under the TripleC arcade, carrying about their digital assets. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao">Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)<a class="hash-link" href="#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The governing structure of TripleC platform is expected to evolve to fully decentralized and autonomous. It is through a bottoms-up management approach that our goal of game democracy is accomplished. The ultimate governance is in hands of game communities, manifested in the functions of CCCG token. By holding CCCG token, each community member could propose and vote for the direction of the platform, i.e. game launching schedule, budget allocation, etc. And those concensus proposals will be put in action by the execution team. Whereas to initiate, and eventually to sustain a fully functioning DAO, the execution team will first step in to layout a rewarding system that encourages pro-community activities. Typical design would include Proof-of-Staking (PoS) for validators, token rewards for voting and proposing, just to name a few. The prosperity of community is coupled with the value of TripleC token. Community advocates, those who hold significant amount of governance tokens and are actively participating in the community movements, are the ones who could mostly enjoy economic return. DAO is probably the first down-to-earth practice for the trending concept of X-to-earn, by truly honoring digital sovereignty and democracy. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="subnet">Subnet<a class="hash-link" href="#subnet" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As mentioned in 1.3, the ideal GameFi should have all transactions and digital assets listed on blockchain. Currently, most Web3 games are not fully on-chain due to limited TPS allowed and unaffordable gas fees on blockchain. For the few GameFis that are fully on-chain, their playability is compromised so as to lower the number of concurrent transactions and associated gas fees. A feasible solution to this issue is using subnet. Developing a special public blockchain for game only is not time/cost efficient compared to branching a subnet from established ones. However, many single games are not in the position to negotiate an exclusive subnet with public blockchains, either because the number of players for a single game is limited or their player accumulation over time is an inverted U shape (for the natural life cycle of any game). </p><p>TripleC will work with partners to deploy our ecosystem on a dedicated TripleC subnet, based on an established and secure public blockchain. This application ensures high TPS at the level of hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, with minimum gas fees. All of the games on our platform will not face the dilemma of playbility and efficiency.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="composable-nfts">Composable NFTs<a class="hash-link" href="#composable-nfts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There will be three major types of NFTs on TripleC platform: SBT NFTs, game NFTs and art NFTs. SBT is a special identity token issued by TripleC platform that cannot be traded, as specified in section 3.5. Game NFTs are issued by games as tools to advance the game progress. Art NFTs are either issued by games or TripleC with certain themes for collectible purposes. The art NFTs from TripleC, although sometimes can be an original solo theme, are mostly going to be creations inspired by famous IPs, franchised by our IP partners. </p><p>TripleC structure the NFTs in a way that allows interchangeable gears across platform, games, and themes. These NFTs are composable and decomposable like lego pieces. A player could create an NFT with a character from game A, wear a dress from game B, hold a sword from IP theme C and display an honor badge (SBT) from the platform. A player could collect various gears he needs in different games and come up with one giant NFT. The assembled NFT could still perform in games, but not as a whole, with each piece functioning locally only in its own game. That means, a gear from game X, while presented in full visual across all games, will not perform in battles in games other than X when carried along in an assembled NFT. However, certain combination might sparkle a special force that can slash across games. This is where the wildest imagination is rewarded. This composable design is a savory feed to both functionality and aesthetics. When a player wishes to sell the NFT, the SBT badge will be stripped off while all other pieces could be sold as individual pieces or in a combo. </p><p>TripleC offers such a plug-and-play NFT function to allow compatibility across the whole platform. For players, a uniquely crafted NFT displays their creativity, and delivers a strong personal message. Moreover, a meticulous combination not only augments the asset value, but also records a progressing pathway of a player. For developers, allowing assets to be carried across games increases their exposures, especially when attached to big IPs. This is a way of promotion that new games could take advantage of. </p><p>All in all, the connection created among platform, games, themes could foster a closely-knitted IP universe. This is our attempt at a cohesive metaverse.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="establish-an-ecosystem-for-free-asset-flowing">Establish an Ecosystem for Free Asset-Flowing<a class="hash-link" href="#establish-an-ecosystem-for-free-asset-flowing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="digital-asset-protection">Digital Asset Protection<a class="hash-link" href="#digital-asset-protection" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Both Web2 games and Web3 games have a life cycle. Although there are a handful of phenomenal games stay popular for decades, most traditional games run for averagely 3-5 years before reaching the end of cycle and their servers being shut down. Players&#x27; game accounts and game assets are gone along the end of the game life. Although Web3 games are relatively new and have not yet faced the problem of shutting down, there is a notorious problem for Web3 games known as death spiral, for both player number and token value. Death spiral is not a unique issue for Web3 games, but it is especially quick for Web3. As almost all current Web3 players play to earn, when there is slight disturbance in the market, the dampened motivation of players and decreased value of tokens exacerbate each other. </p><p>TripleC, as a game platform, strive to protect players&#x27; game assets. When players&#x27; interest shifts or before the life cycle of a game ends naturally, players can exchange their game assets into our platform tokens, and continue to use in the next game without value discount. Thus players inputs, time-wise and financial-wise, are recorded and protected on TripleC platform, regardless of game shut-down or severe depreciation. In some cases, even capital gains are highly attainable at the right timing. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="infrastructure-for-free-asset-flowing">Infrastructure for Free Asset-Flowing<a class="hash-link" href="#infrastructure-for-free-asset-flowing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We believe that by building a sufficiently open GameFi infrastructure platform and a loop ecosystem, all users, game developers, and ecological partners can enjoy their value and rights in a sustainable and transparent system. Game tokens, in-game and platform NFTs are all part of the ecosystem, connected and circulated through the medium of TripleC token. Game Matrix, Wallet Container and NFT marketplace are major components of the TripleC digital asset ecosystem.</p><p>I. Games on TripleC platform are DApp independently launched and operated by game developers. They are part of the game matrix on the platform. They utilize tokenomics services from TripleC to define their token mechanism and build sustainable GameFi economics. By exchanging in the wallet with TripleC tokens, which will be listed on major crypto exchanges, in-game tokens realize their liquidity and market value without going through all the hassles of being listed. </p><p>II. TripleC Wallet is a platform container. It provides functions such as asset management, delivery and exchange in the TripleC ecosystem. Players could exchange TripleC tokens with various game tokens in the wallet. Game tokens must first be exchanged into TripleC tokens to purchase other digital assets on the platform. We have designed an innovative market-making algorithm for token exchanges behind the wallet, see section 4.2. The wallet is the central hub in TripleC ecosystem, connecting all tokens and assets. It is the bond between platform and game, as well as among games, linking values and utilities of all digital assets. </p><p>III. TripleC NFT Marketplace is the NFT trading tenet, where users can use TripleC Token to conduct all NFT transactions within the TripleC ecosystem. Players can rent, lease and trade assets, equipment and resources in our NFT marketplace. A market-making algorithm is also constructed for NFT trading specifically in section 4.2.4. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="secure-user-identity-and-data-value">Secure User Identity and Data Value<a class="hash-link" href="#secure-user-identity-and-data-value" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="soulbound-token-sbt">SoulBound Token (SBT)<a class="hash-link" href="#soulbound-token-sbt" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>TripleC will issue &quot;achievement reward&quot; NFTs in the form of SoulBound Token (SBT) to players based on their activities. This NFT is bound to the player&#x27;s wallet address and cannot be transferred or sold once issued. When a player logs in to the TripleC platform and connects to the wallet, all NFTs or honor badges of the player will be displayed, including the SBT NFT. This SBT enables each player in the community to have their own behavioral tags and data monetization channels.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="personal-data-sovereignty-and-monetization">Personal Data Sovereignty and Monetization<a class="hash-link" href="#personal-data-sovereignty-and-monetization" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In the Web2 world, whether it is Meta, Google, or ByteDance, after the platform has accumulated a large amount of user data, the data is opened up to advertisement, to generate revenue for these companies. Users have no autonomy of data, not to mention any share of profit for their own data. Traffic concentration leads to monopoly.</p><p>On the contrary, TripleC believes in data sovereignty, that the data on the chain belongs to the source, our players. The decision power is in the hands of TripleC players, whether to open up on-chain data to advertisers or whether to receive advertisements. Specifically, on TripleC, players have access control over their own SBTs and can choose to open SBTs conditionally. Moreover, the logic of SBT design also enables players to seek monetary benefits from advertisers. When anyone wants to call, analyze or distribute advertisements, they need to pay a certain fee to the player, which grants players independent rights to their data revenue.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="developer-precision-marketing">Developer Precision Marketing<a class="hash-link" href="#developer-precision-marketing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For the ease of developers and business partners, TripleC will encapsulate the distribution of those opened SBT in a SDK and provide it for analysis and invocation. For example, when a new card-based GameFi project wants to acquire customers, it can analyze which players have been issued card-game related SBTs previously, and then conduct specified marketing for these players.</p><p>SBT is a key to unlock value exchanges between DApps: when the cost of information flow on the chain is reduced due to the existence of SBT, the player&#x27;s behavior data can be easily imported into different DApps on our platform, so as to more accurately discover, engage and expand players based on common interests. Such cross-DApps operation will help expand the entire ecosystem in due course.</p><p>To sum up, for players, SBT adds a sense of achievement and commemoration unique to each player, therefore recognizing and encouraging players&#x27; efforts. And players can enjoy digital sovereignty over their own data and obtain profits from it. For business partners, the SBTs bound to the wallets have constructed the player&#x27;s historical behavior label in the Web3 world, which contains valuable data such as identity and preference, making marketing more pinpointed. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="build-derivative-content-space">Build Derivative Content Space<a class="hash-link" href="#build-derivative-content-space" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-derivative-content">What is Derivative Content?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-derivative-content" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As more and more immersive as the experiences grow, players tend to search for derivative content that enhances their interactions with in-game content. On the other hand, game developers utilize derivative content for their long-term operation and marketing. There are two major types of derivative contents: </p><p>I. Recreation based on game content: this includes NFTs, pictures, GIFs, short videos, live-stream game playing. Mostly for entertainment purposes, some are for collection appetite, this type of derivative is usually created to satisfy fans desire for more in-depth immersion, community socialization, alternative investment and psychological involvement of human mirror neuron (mimicry). </p><p>II. Information for gameplay: this includes game strategies, research, updates, tips, comments and live-stream guidance. Mostly for competitive purposes, this type of derivative is usually generated to enhance players skills, guide them for leveling-up, and hence fulfilling players&#x27; eagerness for victory. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-derivative-content-space">Why Derivative Content Space?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-derivative-content-space" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As a platform, the TripleC ecosystem could not thrive without interactions between game and players. Web2 game industry has repeatedly proven that derivative content is a key to game community prosperity, which accelerate dissemination of games. In addition, there is great synergy between game content and derivative content: the more popular the game is, the higher demand is for derivative content. Timely and precise feed to those demands boost both time and money devotion to the game. If not properly satisfied, such huge demand could generate disappointment and backlash on the popularity of the game. </p><p>In addition to game-derived-content, derivative content space is the front line for TripleC to gradually introduce a variety of platform functions, such as achievement system, medal awards, NTF display space, avatar combined with game NFT, player socialization tags and many others. These platform rewards and collectibles bond with players on top of all the game attractions. </p><p>Moreover, derivative content space is the rooting ground for DAO. All the derivative contents gather relevant players for a certain game, a game community is naturally formed. Using all the tools on TripleC platform, this community could create and publish their own NFTs. And eventually evolve to a DAO, upgrading from a pure sharing and socialization group to autonomous governance for proposing and voting about the game, realizing true game democracy. </p><p>It is difficult for a single game to create a content sharing space in a large scale to attract enough traffic volume. TripleC, as platform, is a perfect field thrive such space, linking players, creators and developers. The goal of this derivative content space is to weave a web to capture traffic by leveraging high-quality derivative content. Such space naturally strengthens the connection between players and developers through &quot;content&quot; and &quot;data&quot;. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-benefits">What are the Benefits?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-the-benefits" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There are four main benefits of our derivative content space: </p><p>I. For players, derivative content completes and enhances their gaming experiences. Recreation based on game content provides players with pre-game, in-game and post-game interactions through other&#x27;s creation, in addition to their own gaming experiences. This is an all-around immersion time-wise and perspective-wise. Information types of derivative content eventually form a Web3 game encyclopedia, which facilitates better gameplay and deeper game learning. If created by players themselves, this is a content space that promotes self-expression and peer-to-peer interactions. Together, these derivatives enrich players&#x27; experience and enable community socialization.</p><p>II. For Web3 game developers, this space is a service platform to maintain and acquire customers. Developers could attract a group of core game players through developer-made or guided content, and timely, accurate and authoritative game updates. Through our platform traffic redirection, developers could also expand marketing coverage and filter out potential loyal players. Such space could assist developers in accumulating private domain traffic, mining player data for in-depth marketing, guiding players&#x27; attention, interaction and sharing.</p><p>III. For talents/KOLs, this space is a medium platform for direct interactions with both players and developers. Exposures and qualities are two-way catalysts for each other. High influence brings about high exposures while high exposures promote content quality, which further enhances the influence. We offer a space for KOLs to create and monetize their influences. In general, KOLs monetize their influences in two ways: A. by completing result-oriented tasks to meet requests (normally highly quantified requests for revenue or number of clicks) published by developers. B. by charging advertising fees for content display. </p><p>IV. For TripleC platform, high-quality content, no matter generated by users, KOLs or developers, will increase players&#x27; engagement in the platform games in general. And further evolvement to DAO in game communities drives our platform to ultimate decentralized autonomy. Moreover, good content will be rewarded by TripleC tokens for exposure augment. Through the positive cycle of content generation, player engagement and rewarding, the ecosystem would be more sustainable. And more potential usage scenarios are exploited for TripleC token. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-steps-to-develop-this-space">What are the Steps to Develop this Space?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-the-steps-to-develop-this-space" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The logic behind derivative content space is to create a long-term business model for service providers and creators to enter the aforementioned positive cycle. To initiate such a cycle, three phases are inevitable:</p><p>I. To begin the derivative content space, our partner developers will be the first contributors to the ecosystem with OGC (Occupationally-Generated Content). There are many ways developers could participate in the derivative content space to market their games, like in-vitro NFT medals for the platform, game preview videos, illustrated guides, just to name a few. </p><p>II. Directed by inspirations or token incentives, KOLs are likely to be the second group to come in with PGC (Professionally-Generated Content). Videos, gameplay guides, etc. </p><p>III. With prevailing content by developers and KOLs, ordinary players are encouraged to express themselves by UGC (User-Generated Content). Avant-garde creations are even more welcome in the world of Web3. </p><p>Most importantly, for all three creators, besides similar ways of content creation as in Web2 games, all creations could be presented in NFT on our platform. We will provide infrastructures to mint, promote and exchange NFTs generated. </p><p>Along all phases of derivative content space, from time to time, TripleC will jump in with platform NFTs to add spice to the market. These NFTs could be a solo theme or co-branded with an IP or a game. Mingled with other NFTs published by developers, KOLs or even players, these derivatives are important parts of the metaverse under TripleC platform. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cccg-tokenomics">CCCG Tokenomics<a class="hash-link" href="#cccg-tokenomics" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="functions-of-cccg">Functions of CCCG<a class="hash-link" href="#functions-of-cccg" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The TripleC platform token CCCG is TripleC&#x27;s governance and utility token, granting the highest-level of privilege in the TripleC ecosystem. The CCCG holders will be given the right to participate in the operation of the ecosystem, in addition to the natural characteristics of being held, transferred and exchanged in accordance with blockchain standards.</p><p>The TripleC token represents the ecological value of the platform and has four main utilities:</p><p>-<!-- --> Transactions: CCCG token is an exchange medium and also a payment method on the TripleC platform. CCCG could be converted to and from game tokens in the wallet. CCCG tokens is also used to create and trade NFTs on the platform. There will be fees associated with transactions, charged in the form of CCCG.</p><p>-<!-- --> Staking: CCCG holders choosing to stake their CCCGs would be able to validate transactions in the TripleC ecosystem, Proof-of-Staking (PoS). Validators will earn rewards in the form of CCCG tokens. </p><p>-<!-- --> Governance: CCCG holders will have rights to propose and vote. In order to submit a proposal for voting, a certain threshold of tokens is required. For a proposal to be accepted, it must be endorsed by a sufficient number of token holders. The voting power is proportional to amount of token held. Participating in platform governance earns players CCCG as rewards. </p><p>-<!-- --> Rewards: CCCG reward is guaranteed on the platform level for pro-community activities, including staking and governance as mentioned above. Reward is also earned for DeFi activities, such as providing for liquidity pools. The latter kind of reward is subject to investment risk associated with each DeFi product, which will be defined in details at a later date. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assignment-of-cccg">Assignment of CCCG<a class="hash-link" href="#assignment-of-cccg" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>TripleC will issue the platform token CCCG. The total supply of TripleC tokens is 2 billion. All CCCGs are generated on the date of TGE (Token Generation Event) and subject to later vestings. The allocation is shown as below:</p><p>-<!-- --> 51% will be allocated to the ecosystem. Two primary contributors to the ecosystem are content providers (game studios/developers) and players, while players take up the majority of the voice on the platform in the end (over 80%). Some of the early content providers are also founding contributors to the platform, and will become part of the TripleC foundation. Players can acquire CCCG through exchange with earned game tokens or transactions in the open market. </p><p>-<!-- --> 15% will be allocated to the founding team and platform developers as incentives. </p><p>-<!-- --> 10% will be allocated to the seed round investors.</p><p>-<!-- --> 10% will be allocated to the private round investors.</p><p>-<!-- --> 5% will be allocated to the treasury pool to help operate the ecosystem. Initially, 1% will be allocated to the pool to cover marketing costs for early promotion of the platform, for instance, initial establishment of the marketing matrix. To sustain the system, tokens obtained as platform revenue from commissions and other platform service fees will gradually accumulate in the treasury pool, and will be used for long-term development and expansion.</p><p>-<!-- --> 4% will be allocated to external advisors involved in the initial development and design of the platform. Their expertise helps to build and expand the platform.</p><p>-<!-- --> 3% will be allocated to crypto exchange to provide initial liquidity in public sale after TGE.</p><p>-<!-- --> 1% will be allocated to public sale right before TGE/listing, in forms of whitelist or initial DEX offering (IDO). </p><p>-<!-- --> 1% will be allocated to players who commit time and effort into testing our first few games before TGE. These early community participants will be rewarded by airdrop. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vesting-of-cccg">Vesting of CCCG<a class="hash-link" href="#vesting-of-cccg" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The vesting schedule of CCCG is listed below based on their categories. Typical schedules consist of a lock-up period (cliff) followed by a linear vesting schedule. For example, 6M cliff, 24M linear monthly vesting for seed investors means that from the day of TGE, tokens for seed investors will be locked for 6 months, afterwards, their tokens will be vested every month for the next 24 months. Each month the vested amount will be 200,000,000/24=8,333,333,333. And the total time to vest all of the tokens for seed investors would be 6+24=30 months after TGE. </p><p>There are two special categories in our vesting schedule, ecosystem and treasury. Their vestings will be discussed in the following paragraphs. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-vesting">Ecosystem Vesting<a class="hash-link" href="#ecosystem-vesting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>51% of CCCG is allocated to the part of ecosystem. The vesting schedule for ecosystem is to ensure natural growth in accordance with the number of users and ecological prosperity. Both content providers and players are contributors to the ecosystem. </p><p>For content providers, before game release, TripleC will allocate a certain amount of CCCG to exchange with their game tokens at a carefully calculated ratio. This is to ensure the overall balance of the ecosystem in several ways:</p><p>I. Content providers and the platform are on the same side, building the ecosystem together with exchanged and shared interests. These pre-allocated game tokens exchanged to TripleC are also part of TripleC ecosystem, and will be put in a game token basket.</p><p>II. At the early stage of a game, if players wish to push progress in a game but choose not to spend time playing to earn game tokens, this basket will serve as the initial liquidity provider for players who wish to exchange CCCG for game tokens, when there is no large circulation of game tokens in the market on TripleC platform. </p><p>III. Values of CCCG and game tokens are entangled in an ETF model to support token value using the concept of dynamics index and basket. The latter design is our answer to the infamous death spiral for single games (please refer to section 4.3 for its mathematical model). </p><p>IV. When there is an extra amount of game tokens no longer needed for liquidity or index basket, they could be sold for CCCG. This additional income stream would be further used to sustain the platform.</p><p>This exchanged amount of CCCG is allocated to content providers from ecosystem part of tokens, whereas the vesting schedules vary among different content providers according to boarding time and game designs. A typical schedule would include a cliff period followed by linear or non-linear vesting. </p><p>For players, there are two major ways to unlock CCCGs in the ecosystem:</p><p>I. Acquire rewards through pro-community activities. These activities include validation for transactions or Proof-of-Staking (PoS), voting and proposing for platform governance. CCCGs are vested to these community participants as rewards.</p><p>II. CCCG is vested through initial conversion from game tokens. The conversion ratio is determined by players&#x27; auction. Players can obtain CCCG by participating in the Dutch price auction on the platform. This initial conversion for a game token to CCCG in the auction process is where this portion of CCCG is first vested to the hands of players. The auction process is as follows:</p><p>An arbitrary cap price is set, such as 1000A game tokens = 1CCCG. Taking the auction of 1000 CCCGs as an example with players&#x27; bids as follows:</p><p>Since the total demand reaches 1000 of the token supply at the price of 700A, the final auction result is 700A game tokens = 1CCCG, and players ABCD can obtain the CCCG amount they requested at a price of 700:1, totaling 900 CCCG tokens. Player E and Player F bid on the margin (ie the cutoff winning bid price), but because the total bid amount of 1900 exceeds the supply amount of 1000, E and F who bid on the margin allocate the remaining 100 coins in a pro-rata fashion of 900:100, that is, E gets 90 CCCG tokens and F gets 10 CCCG tokens. These CCCG tokens converted via auction are then vested and available in the open market. </p><p>Such a design assures that the exchange price reflects the supply and demand of tokens. Such a dynamic equilibrium, together with game popularity and game progress, will determine the frequency of auctions for each game. This is going to be part of the design of in-game tokenomics, and will be balanced with the platform to reach overall sustainability. </p><p>Once the auction is done, the initial exchange ratio between CCCG and the game token is determined. At the early stage of a game, TripleC will act as the liquidity provider for those who wish to exchange CCCG for game tokens, dispatching from its basket of game tokens. The price/exchange ratio will be the same as the last auction before the next one takes place. When the circulation of the game token on TripleC platform is large enough to support market-driven exchange, TripleC will establish order book+AMM/CPMM (section 4.2 for details) on the backend of the wallet to facilitate exchanges both ways. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="treasury-vesting-injection-and-burning">Treasury Vesting, Injection and Burning<a class="hash-link" href="#treasury-vesting-injection-and-burning" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Treasury is a dynamic pool to support longterm operation of the platform, as well as a buffer to sustain the ecosystem. As burning is conducted in the treasury, it is also considered the modulator for circulation and total supply. It is the central piece connecting revenue and platform operation. </p><p>At first, 5% of CCCG will be allocated to the treasury pool, from which 1% of CCCG will be unlocked at TGE for early operation of the platform, primarily marketing costs to promote the platform. The rest of the 4% allocation is initially planned to be vested linearly on a monthly basis for the next two years. </p><p>In the process of auction and exchange of tokens, minting, sale and rental of NFT, basically all transactions on chain, TripleC will charge small amount fees in CCCG, and these CCCG collected by TripleC is considered as part of token revenue on the platform. This revenue will be injected into treasury, then split between platfrom operation and burning. These injected CCCGs are already vested from other channels. The injection frequency and amount will in return adjust the original vesting schedule of the treasury to maintain a proper operation budget and circulation amount in the market. The proportion for burning is to be determined later, taking into consideration both platform functionality and token value preservation. In cases where revenue is piling up too quickly, in other words, the treasury pool is filling too quickly and fixed proportional burning is suppressing the circulation too heavily, the platform could either tune the burning proportion or introduce another outlet of revenue, e.g. share revenue with ecosystem to reward token holders as dividends, which shall be later determined by the TripleC foundation or community votes. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="circulation-of-cccg">Circulation of CCCG<a class="hash-link" href="#circulation-of-cccg" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There are primarily two kinds of revenue for the platform. One is fees from all transactions, including token auction and exchange, NFT sale, minting and rental, etc. The other is the sale of pre-allocated game tokens to TripleC. These two are going to be used for platform operation in a long run. All fees are going to be collected in the treasury, which will have a burning function embedded and act as a modulator for the circulation of CCCG. The flow of CCCG revenue and their connections are summarized below: </p><p>The total amount of CCCG is fixed and TripleC has no plan for additional issuance. Due to the limited total number and the burning mechanism, CCCG will be deflationary in the long run. The total amount of circulation is the sum of all vested CCCG (pre-TGE holders&#x27; vestes amount + CP&#x27;s vested amount + exchange liquidity + rewards + auction + treasury release) minus burned CCCG. However, the vesting and burning schedule of CCCG will not always be synchronized. Therefore, in the process of gradual vesting and burning of platform tokens, the circulation amount of the platform token might increase (inflation) or decrease (deflation).

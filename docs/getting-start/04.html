Most game developers, especially those making traditional web2 games, do not know about blockchain, crypto, and tokenomics. They also probably do not want to learn about the new web3 tech stack because they want to focus on making good games in terms of content, graphics, playability, etc. Yet, tokenomics is a crucial part of web3 games. It is different for each game. TripleC will advise the web2 game developers to design token economies that are customized to their games. </p><p>Tokenomics is defined as the supply and demand characteristics of a cryptocurrency project. It is central to the in-game economy of a web3 game. Tokenomics is to a game token as the central bank’s monetary policy is to the fiat currency. The tokenomic policy determines how a particular token is allocated (schedule) and what the tokens are for (utility). The schedule and the utility in turn influence the supply and demand, respectively, and hence the price of the token. There are many details that go into a particular tokenomic ecosystem. TripleC will assist game developers to navigate the myriad of decisions they need to make to create web3 games. The main decisions are as follows.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mining-vs-staking">Mining vs Staking<a class="hash-link" href="#mining-vs-staking" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Mining, as in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum 1.0 (Eth1), gives new tokens to those gamers who devote computer resources to validate transactions and add them as new blocks on the chain in a decentralized network of computers. This is also known as proof-of-work. Staking, as in Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2), rewards those gamers who lock up some tokens in a smart contract to validate new transactions. If they improperly validate bad or fraudulent data, they will be penalized by losing part or all of the stake. This is also known as proof-of-stake. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is more scalable because it is much more energy efficient, whereas proof-of-Work (PoW) is more robust because the network cannot be easily “bought” by the largest stakeholders.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="to-burn-or-not-to-burn-when-to-burn">To Burn or Not to Burn, When to Burn<a class="hash-link" href="#to-burn-or-not-to-burn-when-to-burn" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>While some cryptos like Bitcoin do not have a token-burning program, many others such as Ethereum (starting in August 2021) and Binance’s BNB do burn tokens to reduce the quantity in circulation. According to the law of supply and demand, reducing the availability of tokens shall, theoretically and all else fixed, increase the price of the token, at least in short term. For instance, new investors may enjoy burning after a successful launch of ICO because their tokens will appreciate and be less subject to over circulation. Also, a token, such as KuCoin, that has a periodic burning scheme may be more attractive to token holders because the value of their digital assets increases from time to time.</p><p>There are several ways to burn tokens. The simplest is to buy back tokens and send them to a frozen private address where there is no private key. The tokens sent can never be recovered or withdrawn. They no longer exist. Alternatively, with every transaction, the sender pays a small fee using the tokens, which are then destroyed in the process. Ethereum collects the gas fees generated from transactions and burns those Ethereum.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="limited-vs-unlimted-supplies">Limited vs. Unlimted Supplies<a class="hash-link" href="#limited-vs-unlimted-supplies" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>An important part of a tokenomic ecosystem is to specify the supply mechanics. A limited supply token caps the number of tokens that can and will ever exist at a maximum. After that, the circulating supply can only decrease thru burning, loss, stash, etc. For example, the number of Bitcoins that will ever be minted is 21 million. In addition, the issuance rate specifies how many tokens are added to the ecosystem each period. From 2016 to 2020, there were 12.5 new Bitcoins created every 10 minutes. After May 11th, 2020, the minting dropped to 6.25 Bitcoins per the same duration. This is equivalent to that roughly every 4 years the issuance rate is halved. This process continues until all 21 million Bitcoins are minted around the year 2140, after which no more Bitcoins will be created.</p><p>A limited supply token together with a burning schedule defines a deflationary ecosystem. A deflationary system is one such that the total number of tokens decreases over time. BNB is an example. The main benefit of a deflationary ecosystem is token price appreciation through scarcity.</p><p>On the other hand, an unlimited supply token is an inflationary system in which new tokens are entering into circulation all the time. There is no limit to how many tokens will exist. Eighteen million Ethers are mined each year. Given enough time, there can be an arbitrarily large number of Ethers available. However, this does not mean that Ether will become worthless. First, the inflation rate decreases over time. Suppose there are 120 million Ethers now. The inflation rate is 18/120=15%. In 10 years, there will be 120+（18 x 10）=  300 million Ethers. The inflation rate will be down to <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>18</mn><mn>300</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>6</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{18}{300}=6 \%</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.1901em;vertical-align:-0.345em"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mopen nulldelimiter"></span><span class="mfrac"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8451em"><span style="top:-2.655em"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">300</span></span></span></span><span style="top:-3.23em"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em"></span><span class="frac-line" style="border-bottom-width:0.04em"></span></span><span style="top:-3.394em"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">18</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.345em"><span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose nulldelimiter"></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8056em;vertical-align:-0.0556em"></span><span class="mord">6%</span></span></span></span></span>.

There is often a waiting period before they start to receive the tokens and can sell them for money. Otherwise, if they all received the tokens at the same time, that would create a surge in the circulating supply and hence a fall in token price. If they all sold the tokens at the same time, that would create even a bigger and sudden price drop (and loss of confidence) in the token. A careful token allocation and release or vesting schedule are critical to minimizing the impact on circulating supply and token price, hence maintaining a healthy economy.</p><p>Vesting is the process of locking and distributing purchased tokens according to a predefined schedule. Cliff is the period when the tokens are locked before a vesting schedule starts. This scheme intends to delay access to the assets being offered. There are two main vesting schedules.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="linear-vesting">Linear Vesting<a class="hash-link" href="#linear-vesting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Using a linear vesting schedule, tokens are distributed in equal parts for some time. For example, 10,000 CCCGs are distributed each quarter for 4 quarters for a total of 40,000 CCCGs. If a cliff of 6 months is added, then the first batch of tokens will be transferred in the 7th month for 4 consecutive quarters. See Figure 1</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="12333" src="/assets/images/7-d1531f20f07f7cfd32ddf96363fb9f80.png" width="4180" height="1943" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Figure 1: a linear vesting schedule</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="twisted-vesting">Twisted Vesting<a class="hash-link" href="#twisted-vesting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We can design a customized vesting schedule to suit a particular purpose. For example, 24% of the tokens are distributed monthly in the first 3 months, followed by a cliff of 6 months, then the rest of the 76% are distributed after. In addition, for the same vesting schedule, e.g., quarterly distribution, using different cliffs for different parties can spread out the releases. For example, party A receives tokens in Jan, April, July, and October; while party B receives tokens in Feb, May, August, and November.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="12333" src="/assets/images/8-5157e8074b2b0f9c3f0f31e0b91f1844.png" width="4180" height="1943" class="img_ev3q">
Figure 2: a twisted vesting schedule</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="triplec-as-the-custodian">TripleC as the Custodian<a class="hash-link" href="#triplec-as-the-custodian" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The simplest method to distribute tokens to stakeholders according to a vesting schedule is to have the game developers hold onto all these tokens and then airdrop them to the stakeholders on the release dates specified by the schedule. However, this method is insecure. The game developers have control over a large number of tokens. They can sell them off beforehand or they may cancel the release altogether. It is entirely up to them to honor the agreement (or not).</p><p>TripleC solves this trust problem by acting as a third-party custodian between the game developers and the stakeholders. We will audit their smart contracts for the vesting schedules and certify their validity. We will hold onto those reserved tokens and release them according to the schedules. In addition, TripleC will provide an API and an interface to facilitate the creation of customized vesting schedules. See Figure 3.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="12333" src="/assets/images/9-d167f1f0fc8880ac3c521fa98637bf54.png" width="4005" height="1755" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Figure 3: an interface to create a vesting schedule</p><p>By leveraging TripleC as a trusted platform to act as the custodian of tokens, the advisor, auditor, and administrator of a good vesting schedule, we help prevent market dumping and token price manipulation as well as increase transparency. This in turn will help fundraising of the projects because the investors have more faith in the security of their investment.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="game-economy">Game Economy<a class="hash-link" href="#game-economy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A web3 game economy mirrors the real-world economy as it also has a real economy and a financial economy. Game tokens are the fiat currency in the virtual world, whereas non-fungible tokens (NFTs) signify ownership of in-game assets. NFTs can represent any digital assets such as virtual land, houses, avatars, pets, weapons, and costumes. Some provide certain benefits to the gamers, e.g. powerful magical weapons, making them progress faster; some are purely cosmetic, e.g., avatars and costumes, and do not affect gameplay. The in-game real economy concerns the production of game tokens and NFTs, purchase and flow of goods (weapons and armor) and services (mercenaries, PvP) within the game. Gamers produce game tokens (or earn “wages”) and NFTs by “working” such as completing quests, battling other players, and progressing through the game levels. They can also trade tokens and NFTs with other gamers, just like in the real-world real economy.</p><p>TripleC operates a marketplace where gamers can buy and sell game tokens and NFTs in terms of real-world money such as USD. See Figure 4. The marketplace essentially mixes virtual and real realities to create what we call mixed reality. What happens in the virtual world can now have consequences in the real world. For instance, gamers playing the Play-to-Earn (P2E) games can make a living by selling the tokens and NFTs collected in the games. Filipinos full-time playing Axie Infinity is a classic example before its downfall. See Section 5 for a more sustainable token model. Although still in its infancy, mixed reality is happening everywhere in one form or another, from virtual meetings to digital services, from token trading to virtual land NFT sales. This bridge opens up a lot of possibilities for imagination and innovations.</p><p> <img loading="lazy" alt="12333" src="/assets/images/10-90fd22dbcdaf83dec4120f60c25ac29d.jpg" width="632" height="1234" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Figure 4: TripleC marketplace</p><p>On the other hand, the financial economy concerns the aspects of the economy that deal purely in transactions of game tokens and other financial assets that represent ownership or claims to ownership of real sector goods and services. The role of a financial economy is to boost the whole economy, in terms of GDP, productivity, number of gamers, etc., by efficiently allocating resources (tokens and NFTs) across different real-economy activities (quests, minting/breeding new NFTs) and across time (lending and borrowing of tokens and NFTs).</p><p>TripleC provides a platform for token holders to earn yields, i.e., more tokens, by enabling, facilitating, and regulating various DeFi activities, such as lending, borrowing, trading, insurance, and derivatives. When DeFi gamers carry out these activities, there are two fees generated: (1) the gas fee from the underlying blockchain, and (2) the protocol fee from interacting with the protocol. They are the sources of revenue.</p><p>Lending/borrowing tokens to a Decentralized EXchange (DEX) receives/sends payments for providing/acquiring liquidity. It makes trading possible and stabilizes token prices. The profit is from trading volume and the risk from impermanent loss. See Section 4.2.2 for further details. Likewise, leasing a digital asset, e.g., an enchanted magical sword, to another gamer generates profit from interests; the risk is credit and default risk. Yields from trading, buying and selling digital assets protocols depend on the strategies deployed and how good their businesses are. Gamers may be subject to the risk of loss of capital. Insurance and derivative protocols are when gamers lock up their tokens which are to be used only when certain pre-specified events, e.g., a gamer defeated by a dragon, happen. A party can buy a put option to protect the value of his/her digital house or land, limiting the amount of maximum loss, as in Figure 5. The yields depend on the products underwritten and the gamers may also suffer the loss of premiums.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="24343" src="/assets/images/11-c98ddcdf05a548bf8ba8c362f31eb482.png" width="3680" height="2314" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Figure 5: buying a put option on a house limits the loss beyond a certain price <img loading="lazy" src="file:////Users/ui-design/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image017.png" alt="img" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusions-for-game-tokenomics-services">Conclusions for Game Tokenomics Services<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusions-for-game-tokenomics-services" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We have listed five important aspects, elements, or features of a tokenomics or tokenomics policy. As an example, using TripleC’s feature matrix, Ethereum has this tokenomics: {PoS, Burn, Unlimited supply, DeFi = lending to DEX}.</p><p>Tokenomics is a new and evolving technology. It is very complex with many features and dimensions. There are many details in each dimension. Crafting a good policy for a game is important to initially attract investors and gamers. A healthy policy is necessary for an ongoing sustainable economy. For example, tokens not properly burnt or vesting schedules of excessive distribution can cause the token price (and the project) to plummet. Specifying all particulars in a policy, overcoming the complexity and technicality of DeFi protocols, setting up proper security to prevent hacking and heist, and coding them up in smart contracts are likely beyond the ability of traditional or web2 game studios. Game developers like to stay focused on what they are best at doing. They would rather program games, content, graphics, sounds, and playability rather than smart contracts. Likewise, designing financial contracts and derivatives is the job of quantitative finance experts, not game developers. TripleC, as a game incubator, will assist them in all steps in working out their successful tokenomics policies customized for the web3 games.</p><h2></h2><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="market-making">Market-Making<a class="hash-link" href="#market-making" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="limit-order-book">Limit Order Book<a class="hash-link" href="#limit-order-book" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Most modern equity exchanges are order-driven markets.

experience of numerous stocks and assets worldwide. However, it is not popular in the crypto world because LOB assumes liquidity of the assets traded. There are counterparties on both the bid and ask sides all the time. Many tokens are sparsely traded. When you want to buy (or sell), there may not be a counterparty to trade with you. To solve this problem, the crypto world creates these automated market-making (AMM) robots that are always ready to trade with you and quote you a price for the tokens. Moreover, anyone with tokens can create these robots. These so-called decentralized exchanges are basically liquidity pools (LP) together with AMMs.</p><p>All DEXes use a deterministic function to determine the price of a token pair. Uniswap pioneers the Constant Product Market Makers (CPMM). There are other variants that are similar. Notable ones are Constant Sum Market Makers, Constant Mean Market Makers, and Curve (a.k.a.

reserves after a transaction</p><p>However, these kinds of pricing functions like CPMM are economically flawed. The first fundamental problem is that it is very easy to front-run an order. After an order is submitted to an LP, it is authenticated but not settled. It is important to note that the settlement price is determined by the pricing formula, hence the <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span></span></span></span></span> and <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em">y</span></span></span></span></span> reserves, at the time of settlement not the time of submission. Thus, during the pending of settlement, anyone who has access to the LP can submit the same order but with a higher fee for a higher priority for execution, and then another order at a later time at a lower fee to reverse and close the position. A limit order book has no such problem as all price information is transparent to all at all times.</p><p>The second fundamental problem is that these AMMs and pricing functions do not concern about the “true” prices of tokens and thus arbitrage opportunities abound at the cost of investors.

quadratically lower price to earn a positive profit. Therefore, over-trading in one LP gives rise to “ping-pong” trading where arbitrageurs trade back and forth among two or more LPs. The arbitrage trades are the mechanism that DEXes use to equalize prices or to discover the “true” price of tokens by moving information between LPs. They are paid for doing unnecessary work at the cost of investors. In contrast, the limit order book mechanism does not require these arbitrageurs in the price discovery process as all price information is transparent to all at all times. (Park 2021) estimated that for the trading of “wrapped” Bitcoin to USDT, in January 2021, more than 10% of investors stood to lose (theoretically) 53 bps or more of their trade size by using a swap exchange such as UniSwap, compared to using a limit order book.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-1"><a class="hash-link" href="#-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="market-making-algorithms-for-game-tokens">Market-Making Algorithms For Game Tokens<a class="hash-link" href="#market-making-algorithms-for-game-tokens" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>TripleC proposes to use a hybrid of a limit order book and AMM to create what we call “Exchange with AMM robots” (ExAMM) to deliver the best of both worlds. An ExAMM can also allow investors to set up more complicated orders or conditional orders to manage risks that would otherwise be not feasible with the current AMM technology, such as stop, stop limit, market if touched, limit if touched, trail, and trail limit. In an ExAMM, a robot or group of robots inserts orders into an order book, providing the convenience of a centralized exchange trading with the predictable liquidity of AMM. TripleC provides a mathematical framework to create and study these AMM robots.</p><p>An AMM robot does two things: it quotes limit orders to the market to provide liquidity (and earn profits and fees) and executes market orders to mitigate risks. A market-making strategy thus has two components: a limit order strategy and a market order strategy.

The AMM, at the beginning of a day when the robot has little inventory and when the spread is wide, tends to place limit orders. When the robot starts accumulating more position, it places market orders to reduce inventory to reduce risk. Closer to the end of the day, the robot tends to place more market orders to reduce inventory to clear position before going offline. When placing limit orders, the robot makes better offers, (Ba-, Bb+), when the spread is wide. Figure 8 shows the AMM strategy graphically. The mathematics above computes exactly the boundaries of regions.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="See Figure 7" src="/assets/images/14-639e564215bfaf87f9cdbab56f44f2df.png" width="1192" height="508" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Figure 8: an AMM strategy</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="market-making-algorithms-for-nfts">Market-making Algorithms For NFTs<a class="hash-link" href="#market-making-algorithms-for-nfts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The TripleC market-making framework of using a limit order book together with AMMs auto inserting quotes to the order book is a generic framework for operating a crypto marketplace. Section 0 provides a mathematical foundation to build these trading robots when there is enough trading volume. However, in the web3 game world, some items are so rare that they have no transaction history or even quotes. For example, the “extra life coin” in the movie “Ready Player One” is a unique and powerful item. We will need a different mathematical foundation to estimate their prices so that the robots can insert their quotes into the limit order book.</p><p>The problem of estimating the price of a rare item in a game is similar to the problem of estimating house value in the real world. A particular house is in a sense a rare item because it is not traded every day. The last transacted time was probably one or two decades ago. There are probably even no (daily) quotes for it. Yet, we can estimate the house price by looking at the prices of the other houses sold in the neighborhood. That is, we look at the prices of other houses with similar features, such as location, size, and access to schools, and use those prices to estimate the house price. Essentially, estimating the price of a rare item (or house value) is then a machine learning problem.</p><p>Supervised machine learning algorithms intend to identify a function that is able to give accurate out-of-sample forecasts.

for estimating rare item values. First, support vector machine (SVM) is used because it works well with high dimensional data, semi-structured and unstructured data, and is seen as a more powerful tool to make accurate predictions already in the real estate market. Second, due to many decision trees participating in the process, random forest (RF) is used because it can reduce the over-fitting of data. Previous property research has also demonstrated that random forest is a robust algorithm that provides accurate predictions also in the real-estate market. Third, gradient boosting machine (GBM) is also used because it is considered as an emerging machine learning algorithm with high flexibility. It also provides better accuracy than many other machine learning algorithms, as suggested by Kaggle Data Science Competition.</p><p>Support Vector Machine (SVM) is mostly used as a classifier to find a hyperplane in an n-dimensional space (the number of features) that can separate objects of different categories while maximizing the distance between data points of each category to the separating hyperplane. This classification method can be achieved within the same feature space or by projecting the features into a higher dimensional plane. Data are more easily separable in higher-dimensional spaces because there exists a kernel function for any data set to be linearly separated. SVM can also be used as a regression method that input x can be mapped onto an m-dimensional feature space employing non-linear mapping, to construct a linear model in the feature space.</p><div

RF constructs many decision trees at training, and predictions from all trees are combined to make the final prediction, usually by taking an average. Employing random sampling with replacement reduces the variance associated with those algorithms that have high variance, typically decision trees.</p><p>Gradient Boosting (GB) gives a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, which are typically decision trees. When a decision tree is the weak learner, the resulting algorithm is called gradient-boosted trees; it usually outperforms random forest.

The innovations of CCCG are two-fold. First, CCCG creates a new type of digital economy by bringing together the web2 play-for-fun (P4F) gamers and the web3 play-to-earn (P2E) workers <strong>Invalid source specified.</strong> so that the monetary value, as in USD, of the token is backed by a real economy. I propose and name this new concept or new digital economy “play-for-fun-and-earn” or P4FaE. Second, Triple C backs the token by guaranteeing a lower bound of the token dollar value by pegging CCCG to a basket of other game tokens of the games published on the Triple C platform. As a result, the CCCG dollar value inflates more surely, is less volatile, and is resistant to the death spiral.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="basics-about-token-value">Basics about Token Value<a class="hash-link" href="#basics-about-token-value" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>CCCG token is the fiat currency in the Triple C ecosystem.

BTC is the most important example. While BTC so far can sustain its dollar value (despite wild volatility), many such tokens, after an initial pump due to say Internet meme culture, have become worthless and dumped. These tokens have no intrinsic dollar value.</p><p>Utility tokens, on the other hand, offer services or products <strong>Invalid source specified.</strong>. BNB from the Binance crypto exchange is a prime example. They are like the tokens issued by Timezone[<a href="#_ftn4">4<!-- -->]</a> to play games or tokens to exchange for PS5 consoles. These tokens have an intrinsic dollar value. For instance, a token to exchange for a PS5 is worth at least $500 because that is the official retail price. These tokens represent dollar value in the real economy because they can be exchanged for some utility in the real world. In general, we have</p><table><thead><tr><th>utility token dollar  value = utility dollar value + liquidity premium</th><th><em>eq.</em>  <em>1</em></th></tr></thead></table><p>The liquidity premium accounts for factors such as the supply-demand of the service or goods. The actual dollar value transacted at a time can depend on factors such as the amount in circulation. For example, some enthusiastic fans would be willing to pay $1000 for a PS5 token because it is how much a PS5 is selling on eBay due to (probably unintentional) limited supply from Sony. In this paper, we assume that liquidity premium is non-negative.</p><p>Both types of tokens, having utility or not, are susceptible to the death spiral. A no-utility token can lose its value when the temporary fever for it fades away. A utility token can lose its value when the utility is no more. For example, a PS5 console will have little value in 20 years.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cccg-design">CCCG Design<a class="hash-link" href="#cccg-design" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>CCCG token, the fiat currency in the Triple C ecosystem, is designed with these objectives in mind:</p><ol><li><p>The dollar value of the token grows with the ecosystem.</p></li><li><p>The dollar value is less volatile.</p></li><li><p>The token is resistant to the infamous death spiral.</p></li></ol><p>This “ideal” token has not been seen before in crypto history so far.

When/if there are few players for a game, the game dies. The values of the digital assets of the game also go to zero. This is the main reason why many of the P2E games will inevitably face the death spiral. These P2E games provide no fun or entertainment. There are only producers (making money) doing a silly job like digging holes in the ground and then filling them up.[<a href="#_ftn6">6<!-- -->]</a> There is no utility value. They speculate that more new fools would join to drive the token appreciation. When no more new and greater fools follow, the game enters the death spiral, hence a digital Ponzi scheme<strong>Invalid source specified.</strong>. These producers only make money and do not spend so there are no consumers in these P2E economics.</p><p>Therefore, a successful digital economy in the web3 era will need to bring together both elements of P4F (consumers) and P2E (producers). We call this a Play-for-Fun-and-Earn (P4FaE) economy that loops indefinitely between consumers and producers. See Figure 11. The fun consumption such that people are willing to pay USD for playing and for the digital assets is the utility value of the game and is what backs up the dollar value of the tokens. On the other hand, players can sell their digital assets like game tokens and high-level magical armors for USD to produce monetary value.

of the CCCG dollar value in the next period is 9.09%; the probability of losing 10% is 0.43%; the probability of losing 20% is 0.00028%; the probability of losing 50% is practically zero. Figure 7 shows the bar chart of the probabilities.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="279128" src="/assets/images/21-790a7561fb8044ce8f8de05464fe7848.png" width="3029" height="1819" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Figure 15: the probability of losing % of the CCCG value</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="simulations">Simulations<a class="hash-link" href="#simulations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In this section, we will put the theory into practice. At the first glance, Figure 14 and Figure 15 do not seem to agree with each other. Figure 14 says that the basket token will die before year 4. Figure 15 says that the basket token will never die. The mathematics in Figure 14 implicitly assumes a static basket, meaning that the constituents in the basket do not change. As any game will eventually die, the whole basket will one day die too, just not until a much later extended terminal date.</p><p>CCCG is pegged to a dynamic basket of game tokens. Periodically, the basket is reviewed per an apriori announced policy such that the losers will be removed from the basket and new winners will be added. Because Triple C is a game publishing platform that releases new games constantly, there will always be new winners. CCCG is always pegged to a basket of top performers. The policy describes the number of game tokens included in the basket, the time for the next update, as well as the weights of the tokens.</p><p>We will simulate a particular CCCG basket policy for 10 years. Specifically, we assume that Triple C maintains 50 active games on the platform. CCCG is pegged to the top 10 games every 30 days. CCCG basket is also updated whenever a game dies and is immediately replaced with a new winner. Figure 16 shows the price processes of individual game tokens and CCCG (the gold line). The 50 price processes cover a lot of typical scenarios: crazy appreciation, pre-mature and early death, appreciation followed by the death spiral, etc. The CCCG price stands out: it is the only curve that grows and does not fall to nil all of a sudden, hence no death spiral.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/22-c44da758a22050a94ad5b5d03b2b5f8c.png" width="556" height="324" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Figure 16: the price processes of tokens vs. CCCG</p><p>In general, the sufficient conditions for CCCG to grow are (1) large <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">μ</span></span></span></span></span>  and (2) small <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ρ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\rho</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">ρ</span></span></span></span></span>. The first condition means that the games are potentially good games with an active community of players. In addition, the second condition implies that there needs enough time for the games to grow to full maturity. Because CCCG is sustained by the real economy via the game tokens, the games need to be economically viable for CCCG to succeed.

It is important to point out t    hat eq. 5, Figure 16, and Figure 17 represent a lower bound on the CCCG dollar value because of the pledge from Triple C. The actual transacted value at a time will depend on factors such as liquidity premium as well as the expectation of future value appreciation such as on rebalancing dates.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/23-c0d0311d0a42422f8d4faa45d5807a3d.png" width="556" height="280" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Figure 17: two CCCGs with different sinking probabilities</p><p>We can explain the mathematics in laymen&#x27;s terms. A particular PS5 game may lose its popularity in half a year. It almost certainly will do so in three years. The Playstation console itself (which represents a stream or a dynamic basket of games) will likely survive for many years. Similarly, a particular company or stock may go bankrupt, but the S&amp;P 500, a dynamic portfolio of about 500 stocks, has been growing already for a hundred years and is very likely to continue doing so practically forever (despite some big volatility).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="volatility">Volatility<a class="hash-link" href="#volatility" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Sometimes, there is a misunderstanding that a token price will not grow if it has small volatility.

heading">​</a></h3><p>We have developed a new token that has two much-desired properties in the crypto world:</p><ol><li><p>Grow with the ecosystem.</p></li><li><p>Small volatility.</p></li></ol><p>Triple C achieves this by making the innovation of the “dynamic basket token”. The ecosystem fiat currency CCCG is pegged to a basket of tokens of the top games published on our platform. In operation, anyone can exchange 1 CCCG with Triple C for a pre-specified number of game tokens but not the other way round. Gamers can still trade game tokens for CCCG (or any other game tokens) in the marketplace but not necessarily with Triple C. This mechanism essentially guarantees a lower bound to the CCCG value, backed by the real economy and the dollar values of the game tokens that CCCG is pegged to. The price appreciation of CCCG will depend on the growth of the Triple C ecosystem, circulation/liquidity premium, and the expected price appreciation of the underlying game tokens.</p><p>Our mathematics and simulations show that CCCG is resistant to the notorious death spiral where a game token can lose much of its value either rapidly or gradually. CCCG, being a dynamic basket of tokens, can only enter the death spiral state when most of all its component tokens enter such a state, which is a very low probability event. Our simulation of a particular basket policy confirms this with empirical evidence.</p><p>To construct such a token as CCCG, the issuer needs to</p><ol><li><p>Have a basket of tokens that are tied to the real economy. They need to have intrinsic value due not to speculation.</p></li><li><p>Own a reserve of these tokens to be able to honor the commitment of pegging and exchange.</p></li></ol><p>Triple C is in a unique position to fulfill these conditions. First, Triple C is in the digital game industry. Each digital game contributes to the GDP of the real economy. Playing and paying for a game is worth real USD. Second, Triple C is a digital game publisher. By providing programming infrastructure to developers, promoting and publishing games, Triple C naturally owns a percentage of the game tokens for our services. Triple C’s advantageous positions cannot be easily replicated or superseded.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="disclaimers">Disclaimers<a class="hash-link" href="#disclaimers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The information contained in this document is for general information only.

As we shall show, CCCG lasts much longer than shown in Figure 14. --&gt;</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/getting-start/03"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">What does TripleC Do?</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#game-tokenomics-consulting-service" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight"><strong>Game Tokenomics Consulting Service</strong></a><ul><li><a href="#mining-vs-staking" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Mining vs Staking</a></li><li><a href="#to-burn-or-not-to-burn-when-to-burn" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">To Burn or Not to Burn, When to Burn</a></li><li><a href="#limited-vs-unlimted-supplies" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Limited vs. Unlimted Supplies</a></li><li><a href="#token-allocations-and-vesting-schedules" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Token Allocations and Vesting Schedules</a></li><li><a href="#game-economy" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Game Economy</a></li><li><a href="#conclusions-for-game-tokenomics-services" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Conclusions for Game Tokenomics Services</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#market-making" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Market-Making</a><ul><li><a href="#limit-order-book" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Limit Order Book</a></li><li><a href="#decentralized-exchanges-dex" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)</a></li><li><a href="#market-making-algorithms-for-game-tokens" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Market-Making Algorithms For Game Tokens</a></li><li><a href="#market-making-algorithms-for-nfts" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Market-making Algorithms For NFTs</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#triplec-token-value-model" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">TripleC Token Value Model</a><ul><li><a href="#play-for-fun-and-earn" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight"><strong>Play for Fun and Earn</strong></a></li><li><a href="#basics-about-token-value" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Basics about Token Value</a></li><li><a href="#cccg-design" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">CCCG Design</a></li><li><a href="#simulations" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Simulations</a></li><li><a href="#volatility" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Volatility</a></li><li><a href="#conclusions-for-cccg-value-model" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Conclusions for CCCG Value Model</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#disclaimers" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Disclaimers</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div>

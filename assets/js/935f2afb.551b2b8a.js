Many Web3 games give away playability due to technical challenges and time consumption to develop high-quality GameFis from ground 0. Even if the tech issues and time costs are manageable, extensive number of interactions at the same time on blockchain, which is necessary for an immersively entertaining game, may not be achievable because of TPS limit and appalling gas fees. This drawback further discounts the quality of Web3 games. Moreover, from the marketing side, a Web3 rooted developer usually lacks access to play-for-fun players. Thus, their profitability is only driven by play-to-earn users. This income normally sustains for a short period of time, and comes to an end when no new opportunists enter.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"TripleCWhitepaper/04":{"id":"TripleCWhitepaper/04","title":"How Does TripleC Do It?","description":"The difference between what-to-do and how-to-do lies in the level of details incorporated in the description. In section 3, we laid out the steps to construct the TripleC ecosystem. As a platform, We have a unique and grand architecture in our business model. Our buildout will combine open source, ready-to-use plugins, co-development with partners and self-development. In this section, we are going unfold more details on some of the key parts in our projects. Although creativity is required throughout the process to deliver our products and services, some of the parts are more like technical crafts that require implementation with logic and attention to details, while others require pioneering shifts on the mechanism level. We will skip those steps that are not distinct from other Web3 products on the mechanism level, but dive into the parts that are not widely discussed or available in the market, some parts even fundamentally innovative. There are three topics we are trying to cover here: 1. TripleC consulting services for in-game tokenomics. 2. TripleC token model for sustainable CCCG value. 3. Market-making algorithm behind TripleC wallet and NFT marketplace.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"TripleCWhitepaper/summary":{"id":"TripleCWhitepaper/summary","title":"Summary","description":"GameFi is the easiest and most commercial entry point for Web3.

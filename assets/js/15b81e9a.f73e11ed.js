For example, a new weapon that is essential for leveling up is introduced that costs 100 times more gold coins than usual weapons.

For instance, gamers can transfer these NFTs out of the games and sell them for tokens and eventually real money. These transactions bridge the virtual world and the real world. Players can sell their assets to gain income, while others can buy game props to enhance their strength.

Players immerse themselves in games for entertainment, while enjoying the added benefits of digital sovereignty and game democracy, not the other way around. That's why content is vital. High quality content creates pleasant experiences.
